## Heart Disease Prediction using Bayesian Classification Models
Heart disease is considered as the most common cause of death worldwide. The dataset we
use consists of information about the medical conditions of 918 individuals. In this project,
we explore different probablistic models, namely bayesian logistic regression, hierarchical
models and Gaussian process classification (GPC) to predict the possibility of heart disease
in an individual based on features like age, sex, resting BP, cholesterol etc
